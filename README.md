Kobolds Ate My Baby Character generator and Character sheet

My first indipendant python project, and GUI combination.
I was looking to integrate the character creation rules, and then play rules for the roleplay game Kobolds Ate My Baby.
I utilised KIVY for the GUI while using python to run the program and rules.

Run KAMB.py for the program to run.

Features complete :
  Character generation, character altering during gameplay (hits and equipment changes), character death, tool tips for skills, +Edges and -Bogies
  
Features incomplete:
  test for tool tips, look up for equipment changes to alter HITS and DAM as new equipment is input into the slots. shopping using the VP (for extended games)
